Centuria Industrial REIT is Australia’s largest listed pure-play industrial real estate investment trust, managing a portfolio of 87 high-quality industrial assets valued at approximately $3.8 billion as of December 2024[1]. The trust focuses on urban infill locations, with 90% of its portfolio concentrated on Australia’s eastern seaboard, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, which are critical logistics hubs due to their proximity to transport infrastructure and population centres[2]. CIP’s tenant base is diversified across manufacturing, distribution, transport logistics, and cold storage, with major tenants including Amazon, Linfox, and Toll Group[1]. Occupancy remains robust at 98%, supported by a weighted average lease expiry (WALE) of approximately 7.7 years by income[3].
