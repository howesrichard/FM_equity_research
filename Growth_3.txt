Holman provided A$111 million to sales in HY2025, helping increase Asia-Pacific revenue by 87%.  Integration expenses were negligible, and early synergies saved US$10.8 million. RWC is continuing to grow its SharkBite Max product line through retail distribution, including Bunnings stores in Australia.  To save money and increase productivity, the company is combining warehouses and upgrading its ERP system.  Despite inflationary pressures, these improvements help to boost margins.
